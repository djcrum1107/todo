# todo
Initially The Odin Project's todo assignment/project. After getting the basinc functionality down and practived javascript I am shelving this project and revisit after learning framworks and more css functionality. I will either update this project or start over from scratch.

Created functionality:
- Add a task (explored forms)
- Archive (delete) a task (removing from view and project)
- Switch projects (switch views based on showing and hiding contaners)
- Fit tasks as needed (exploring the css grid and other layouts)

Missing
- Adding a project
- Decend css for buttons, colors, form inputs
- Allow creation of groups
- Tag a project or group as a favorite
- Save/load based on cookies
